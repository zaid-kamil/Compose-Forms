## Code Highlights

### MainActivity
The entry point of the app, setting up the Compose theme and a `Scaffold` with the PagerScreen.

```kotlin
class MainActivity : ComponentActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        enableEdgeToEdge()
        setContent {
            ComposeFormsTheme {
                Scaffold(modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize()) { innerPadding ->
                    PagerScreen(modifier = Modifier.padding(innerPadding))
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### PagerScreen
Handles swipeable navigation between the "About," "Login," and "Sign-Up" screens.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun PagerScreen(modifier: Modifier = Modifier) {
    val pagerState = rememberPagerState(initialPage = 0, pageCount = { 3 })
    Box(
        modifier = modifier.fillMaxSize(),
        contentAlignment = Alignment.Center
    ) {
        HorizontalPager(state = pagerState, modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize()) {
            when (it) {
                0 -> AboutScreen(modifier)
                1 -> LogInScreen(modifier)
                2 -> SignUpScreen(modifier)
            }
        }
    }
}
```
